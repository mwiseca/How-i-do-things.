This shows how i use fgets for integers instead of scanf in C.
All files display the number entered + 1.

the easiest is atoi its used to convert a string to an integer.
It's simple and best used when you do not need to use 0.
The 'if(strlen(number) >= 9){' is used to prevent 
having to press enter twice when using the getc while loop to
flush the input buffer.

For better error checking strtol is used to convert a string to an integer.
It's more complex.

if the input buffer is not flushed.
The 'if(errno == ERANGE){' is used if the user enters to many digits.
I prefer using fgets to scanf so i use these and try to use atoi as its simpler.
As long as i dont need 0.

The strtolWhiteSpace.c lets the users know if they entered spaces between numbers.
It uses a hexadecimal number to keep it simple.
